\section{Conclusion}

This document explained and implemented the Eigenfaces \cite{PT91} and the Fisherfaces \cite{belhumeru97} method with \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/octave}{GNU Octave}/\href{http://mathworks.com}{MATLAB}, \href{http://www.python.org}{Python} and \href{http://opencv.willowgarage.com}{OpenCV2}. \href{http://www.cmake.org}{CMake} was used as a cross-platform build system, which makes it really easy to build platform-dependent Makefiles.
