\section{Introduction}

\href{http://opencv.willowgarage.com}{OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision)} is a popular computer vision library started by \href{http://www.intel.com}{Intel} in 1999. The cross-platform library sets its focus on real-time image processing and includes patent-free implementations of the latest computer vision algorithms. In 2008 \href{http://www.willowgarage.com}{Willow Garage} took over support and OpenCV 2.3.1 now comes with a programming interface to C, C++, \href{http://www.python.org}{Python} and \href{http://www.android.com}{Android}. OpenCV is released under a BSD license, so it is used in academic and commercial projects such as \href{http://www.google.com/streetview}{Google Streetview}.

This document is the guide I've wished for, when I was working myself into face recognition. It helps you with installing OpenCV2 on your machine and explains you how to build a project on Windows and Linux. A face recognition application will be developed to get comfortable with OpenCV2's C++ API. All concepts are explained in detail, but a basic knowledge of C++ is assumed. I've decided to use \href{http://www.mingw.org}{MinGW} (the GCC port for Windows) as C/C++ compiler for Windows, because it works great with OpenCV2 and comes under terms of a public license (please see \href{http://www.mingw.org/license}{mingw.org/license} for details). If someone writes a similar guide for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008/2010, I would be happy to add it to the document.

You don't need to copy and paste the code snippets, there should be a source folder coming with this document. All code in this document is released under a BSD license and the latest versions can be obtained from my github repository at \url{http://www.github.com/bytefish}.
